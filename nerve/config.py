    isn't a mapping — a list, a bare string, a number. Without it the file is
    ignored with a warning, which is a bad failure mode for a config layer:
    every key it was supposed to supply silently reverts to whatever the lower
    layers said, and validation reports the bundle as fine. A truncated write,
    a `yq` mishap, or a merge conflict resolved into a sequence all produce

    An *empty* file (or one that is nothing but comments) still yields ``{}``

    an accent in a name or a prompt hint refuses to load under the service

    Everything else here judges a path against ``<workspace>/config`` or
    ``<workspace>/skills``. That settles whether a path stays inside a subtree,
    and says nothing about whether the subtree is the one the config repo was
    reviewed in. If ``config`` is a symlink out of the workspace, every path
    under it is contained relative to itself, every containment check passes, and
    the whole tracked layer — settings.yaml, the cron files, the gate plugins the
    daemon imports — comes from an untracked directory somewhere else on the box,
    with lockdown itself read from there and reporting that all is well. A
    redirected ``skills`` is the same arrangement one directory over: whatever is
    there gets indexed as model-invocable skills on the next reload.

    So each subtree is judged against the workspace instead, once, and a locked
    instance that fails does not start. The workspace *path* may still be
    anything, including a symlink: where a machine keeps its workspace is a
    machine-local decision and the one thing lockdown never took away.

    Two more ways the same claim fails, checked here for the same reason. A
    subtree can stay inside the workspace and still not be the reviewed tree —
    ``config`` as a symlink to a sibling directory — and ``settings.yaml`` alone
    can leave it while everything around it stays put.

    One problem here is not about a subtree at all: whether the workspace has a
    git remote. It belongs with these because it is the same claim from the other
    side — the reviewed surface is only reviewed if reviewed changes can reach it.
    See :func:`_workspace_remote_problem`.

    """Why this locked workspace has nowhere to receive reviewed config from.

    Lockdown refuses every local change to the reviewed surface and its refusals
    say so, naming the PR flow as the way to change config. That flow ends in a
    git pull: sync is the only route left in. A locked workspace that is not a
    repository, or is one with no remote, has no route at all — every local
    change is refused and no remote change can arrive, so the instance keeps the
    configuration it happens to hold and nothing on the box says why. Nothing
    else reports it, because every other check here judges a tree that is present
    and this one is about a tree that can never change.

    Refused rather than ignored, for the reason the other two rules exist:
    ``lockdown`` in config.yaml/config.local.yaml is not read, and
    ``NERVE_LOCKDOWN`` can lock but never unlock, both so that a machine-local
    change cannot turn lockdown off. ``git remote remove origin`` is a
    machine-local change. Honoring the flag only when a remote happens to be
    configured would make it one more way to unlock the box.

    Any remote counts. Which one to fetch is sync's decision, not this one's:
    with ``workspace_sync.branch`` unset it follows the current branch's own
    upstream, which need not be named ``origin``, so demanding that name would
    refuse a workspace that syncs today. Whether the periodic loop is enabled is
    not asked either — ``nerve config sync`` and ``POST /api/config/sync`` are
    manual routes that work on a locked box with the loop off, so a remote is a
    route regardless.

    Git being unusable is treated as no remote. The answer decides whether a
    locked instance starts, and "could not tell" is not "yes"; a box that cannot
    run git cannot sync either.

    The same rule as :func:`ensure_path_not_tracked_config`, phrased as a value
    rather than an exception, because the agent backends express a refusal by
    returning one — a raise there aborts the turn instead of telling the model
    what to do differently. The wording is aimed at the model for that reason:
    it names the alternative, so a capable agent routes to the review flow rather
    than retrying the same write with a different tool.

    A relative path is taken as relative to the workspace, which is the agent's
    working directory. That can in principle over-refuse for an agent that has
    changed directory into a subtree of its own with a ``config/`` in it; erring
    that way costs a clear message and a retry, and erring the other way is the
    hole this exists to close.

    Every member of :func:`workspace_reviewed_paths` is judged, not ``config/``
    alone. ``skills/`` and the root instruction files are refused by the named
    operations already — ``create_skill`` and friends — and leaving them writable
    here left the whole point of those refusals reachable by the plainest tool
    the agent has: write ``skills/x/SKILL.md``, wait for the reload that indexes
    it, and no 403 was ever involved.

    Both views of the path are checked, because a symlink is the case where they
    disagree and each direction of the disagreement is a way through. Resolving
    catches a path that arrives from outside and lands in the surface — a link in
    the workspace pointing at ``config/``, a directory link, a ``..`` climb. The
    lexical name catches the reverse: a symlink sitting *at* a reviewed path
    resolves elsewhere, and a guard that only resolved would decide the write was
    outside the surface and allow it, while the daemon goes on loading that name
    as tracked config.
